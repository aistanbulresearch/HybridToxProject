# HybridToxProject
A "Safe-by-Design" AI framework for robust toxicity prediction. This Hybrid Mixture of Experts (MoE) integrates Random Forests (Memory) and GNNs (Intuition) to prevent deep learning silent failures. Validated on Tox21 via Nested Scaffold Split, it acts as a fail-safe mechanism in data-scarce regimes.
